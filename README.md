# Basic Flask REST API with SQL-Alchemy Integration

This project demonstrates how to create a simple REST API using Python and Flask, and then integrate it with a Flask SQL-Alchemy database. To get started, clone the repository and set up the necessary dependencies by installing Flask and Flask SQL-Alchemy. Run the application to access a fully functioning REST API at `http://localhost:5000`. The API includes endpoints to handle listing, retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting resources.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Set up a virtual environment and activate it.
3. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the application with `python app.py`.
5. Access the API at `http://localhost:5000`.

Feel free to modify and extend this project to suit your specific needs.
